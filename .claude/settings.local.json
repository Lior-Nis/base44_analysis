The project aims to: 1) Create an application taxonomy using NLP/topic modeling, 2) Develop a complexity assessment rubric, 3) Analyze community sentiment. Current data shows standard React patterns with Radix UI components. What specific analysis approaches would you recommend for: a) Extracting meaningful app features/complexity from source code, b) Identifying unique patterns that distinguish app categories, c) Novel metrics for no-code app quality assessment? Focus on data mining techniques suitable for this codebase structure.\")",
